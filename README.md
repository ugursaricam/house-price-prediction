# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques Dataset

## Data History

The House Prices dataset is a popular machine learning dataset hosted on Kaggle. It was originally compiled by Dean De Cock in 2011, as an extension of the Ames, Iowa Housing dataset. The dataset contains 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, and was collected between 2006 and 2010.

The dataset was made available on Kaggle in 2016 as part of the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" competition, which challenged participants to predict the sale prices of homes based on the provided features. The dataset has since become a popular benchmark for regression models, and has been used in various research studies and competitions.
